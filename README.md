# The only plugin you will ever need!

**ServerCore plugin** lets you add groundbreaking features to your server in a matter of seconds! With a little customization, it can be a great utility plugin for custom server networks or even SMPs.

## Feature roadmap

Features we're looking forward to add:

- `/info [player]` - Displays kills, deaths, server playtime, and current uptime of the player. 
> For staff with `servercore.info` permission, there is additional info such as spawn point location, number of previous bans, number of reports, and latest report info.
